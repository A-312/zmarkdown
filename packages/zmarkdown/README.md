# zmarkdown server HTTP API

### Usage

* See `npm run server`
* `pm2 monit` etc

### Requests
All endpoints respond to `HTTP POST` requests with these keys in their body:

* `md` - required, markdown source string
* `opts` - optional, JSON options

`md` being a boring Markdown string, only `opts` will be specified below.

### Responses

All endpoints return `[contents, metadata, messages]` as JSON.

* `contents` - string, the rendered HTML or LaTeX
* `metadata` - object, depends on request options
* `messages` - string[], info/debug/errors from parsers, plugins, compilers etc

Only `metadata` is described in the **Response** sections below.

# Endpoints

## `/html` - Markdown to HTML

### Request

* `opts.disable_ping`, bool, default: `false`

  [pings][ping] won't get parsed

* `opts.disable_jsfiddle`, bool, default: `false`

  JSFiddle [iframes][iframes] are disabled

* `opts.inline`, bool, default: `false`

  Only parse inline Markdown elements (such as links and emphasis, unlike lists and fenced code blocks)

### Response

* `metadata.disableToc`, bool

  Whether or not the input Markdown did **not** contain headings (`#`, `##`, â€¦). This property is named that way because we use it to disable Table of Contents generation when no headings were found.  
  `disableToc: true` means *no headings*  
  `disableToc: false` means at least on *heading*  

* `metadata.ping`, string[], undefined if `opts.disable_ping: true`

  The list of nicknames returned by `remark-ping`. Can be used to send "ping" notifications to the corresponding users.  
  Note: this is fully customizable, `remark-ping` can validate potential *ping*s by any means, including sending an HTTP request (we recommend `HEAD`) to a REST API to make sure this username actually exists.

## `/latex` - Markdown to LaTeX

### Request

* `opts.disable_jsfiddle`, bool, default: `false`

  see `/html`

### Response

## `/latex-document` - Markdown to tex file
